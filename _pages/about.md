————————————————


I'm a fist year graduate student from [ShangHai University](https://www.shu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision,  machine learning, autonomous driving and synthetic dataset generation.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof.Xu](https://www.shu.edu.cn/info/1608/75532.htm) of Great Lab（Group of Research and Education in AI and Telecom, GREAT）from [School of Communication & Information Engineering](https://scie.shu.edu.cn/), ShangHai University. 


**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
