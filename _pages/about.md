I'm a fist year graduate student from [ShangHai University](https://www.shu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision,  machine learning, autonomous driving and synthetic dataset generation.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof.Xu](https://www.shu.edu.cn/info/1608/75532.htm) of Great Lab（Group of Research and Education in AI and Telecom, GREAT）from [School of Communication & Information Engineering](https://scie.shu.edu.cn/), ShangHai University.
